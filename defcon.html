	<!-- PLACE JAVASCRIPT BELOW STYLESHEETS FOR THE FOLLOWING REASON:
	Drop the script tags in the <head> of your HTML. 
	For best performance, you should have them follow after your stylesheet references. 
	The reason we recommend placing Modernizr in the head is two-fold: 
	the HTML5 Shiv (that enables HTML5 elements in IE) must execute before the <body>, 
	and if you’re using any of the CSS classes that Modernizr adds, you’ll want to prevent a FOUC.

<h2 class="talkTitle">Intro to Memory Forensics With Volatility</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Miguel Antonio Guirao Aguilera <span class="speakerTitle">Security Consultant, Futura - Open Solutions</span></h3>


<p class="abstract">Introduction to Memory Forensics with Volatility is a workshop for those who do not have a clue about forensics, memory forensics or the Volatility Framework. In order to get the most out of this workshop, you should feel comfortable using the command line interface (either Linux/Mac). I order to get a preview of the tool we will be using, visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.volatilityfoundation.org/">http://www.volatilityfoundation.org/</a>.</p>

<p class="abstract">In this workshop, you will learn about memory forensics and how this is performed with one of the best open source frameworks for memory forensics, The Volatility Framework. You will learn how to analyze a memory image or dump, and look for artifacts that enable you, the forensics analyst, to rebuild the digital crime scene and to answer questions as to why, how and when.</p>

<p class="abstract">You will learn to:</p>
<ul class="talkList">
<li>Identify rogue process in memory, maybe from malware or backdoors.
<li>Get details about these process. When they were started, by whom, additional info.
<li>Network connections. From where, at what time, what they launched, etc.
<li>Files opened. With which user, link them with processes.
<li>Find out the command history, in either Linux or Windows.
<li>Check for Signs of a Rootkit
<li>Analyze Process DLLs and Handles 
<li>Dump Suspicious Processes and Drivers
</ul>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Miguel Guirao (aka Chicolinux)</strong> has been in the information security industry for around ten years, he is a freelance consultant at Futura - Open Solutions, where he also has been training professionals about Linux Management, Information Security and Programming. He has been also a professor since 2009 for the Anahuac Mayab University where he teaches at the School of CS Engineering and at the School of Multimedia Design. He teaches Information Security in the Master of Information Technology Management.</p>

<p class="abstract"><strong>Max Class Size:</strong> 55<br>
<strong>Prerequisites for students:</strong> Students must feel comfortable using the CLI (Command Line Interface). Knowledge of the basic commands in Linux, like ls, cd, relative & absolute  path, ps, and so on.<br>
<strong>Materials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate:</strong> Although the Volatility tool is also available to the Windows OS, in order to get it’s full power we will be using GNU/Linux/UNIX so, either install it on your laptop or create a VM with your favorite virtualization software. Volatility requires Python so, in order to save time and get into what really matters, come with your OS fully loaded with the tool and all it’s prerequisites.

<h2 class="talkTitle">Ninja level Infrastructure Monitoring : Defensive approach to Security Monitoring & Automation</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Madhu Akula <span class="speakerTitle">Automation Security Ninja, Appsecco</span></h3>
<h3 class="speaker">Riyaz Walikar <span class="speakerTitle">Chief Offensive Security Officer, Appsecco</span></h3>


<p class="abstract">For most network engineers who monitor the perimeter for malicious content, it is very important to respond to an imminent threat originating from outside the boundaries of their network. Having to crunch through all the logs that the various devices (firewalls, routers, security appliances etc.) spit out, correlating that data and in real time making the right choices can prove to be a nightmare. Even with the solutions already available in the market.</p>

<p class="abstract">As I have experienced this myself, as part of the Internal DevOps and Incident Response Teams, in several cases, I would want to create a space for interested folks to design, build, customize and deploy their very own FOSS based centralized visual attack monitoring dashboard. This setup would be able to perform real time analysis using the trusted ELK stack and visually denote what popular attack hotspots exist on a network.</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Madhu Akula</strong> is an Automation Security Ninja at Appsecco, a company that specializes in Web Application Security. His primary interests lie with application & cloud security, DevOps and Automation. He is a security and DevOps researcher with over 3+ years of experience in the industry. He has expertise in building scalable and secure infrastructure. Implemented security solutions and worked with different clients across Govt, E-Commerce and IT industries.</p> 

<p class="speakerBio">His research has been selected for ToorCon, DefCamp, SkydogCon, NoloCon, etc in the past. He has been a keynote speaker for National Cyber Security conference in Dayananda Sagar College conducted by CompTIA.</p>

<p class="speakerBio">Madhu Akula is also an active member with Bugcrowd, Hackerone, Synack etc. He has found vulnerabilities in open source products/platforms such as WordPress, Ntop, Opendocman etc. and is also a contributing bug hunter with Code Vigilant (a project to Secure Open Source Software). His research has identified many vulnerabilities in over 200 organizations including US Department of Homeland Security, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Adobe, LinkedIn, Ebay, At&t, Blackberry, Cisco, Barracuda etc.</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Riyaz Walikar</strong> is the Chief Offensive Security Officer at Appsecco, a company that specializes in Web Application Security. His primary interests lie with application security, penetration testing and security evangelism. He is a security evangelist, offensive security expert and researcher with over 9 years of experience in the Internet and web application security industry.

<h2 class="talkTitle">Embedded system design: from electronics to microkernel development</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Rodrigo Maximiano Antunes de Almeida <span class="speakerTitle">Professor, Federal University of Itajubá</span></h3>


<p class="abstract">The workshop consists of a introduction on the embedded systems design. We'll start building a simple electronic embedded system design. This will be used as the target platform. Later I pretend to talk about the low level side of C language as bit fields arrays and bitwise operations, pointers to fixed memory addresses/registers, how to access the microcontroler peripherals etc. These will be the base to develop a full embedded microkernel using ISO-C without the standard libraries. They will have a better understanding on the electronics-programming relationship and how these questions can impact on the kernel development. Aside they`ll get a deep knowledge in the kernel basic functions (processes scheduling, i/o drivers controller etc).</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Rodrigo</strong> is a professor at Federal University of Itajubá. He has 9 years working with embedded systems, developing projects both in home and electro-medical appliances. He actually teaches classes on electronics, microcontrollerers and embedded operational systems to electronic engineering students. His researches include topics on hardware development, RTOS security and embedded systems usability. Rodrigo has presented on DEF CON, ESC and BSides conferences, mostly talking about embedded development and related security issues.</p>

<h3 class="speaker">Ruben Boonen <span class="speakerTitle">Lead Security Consultant, Context Information Security</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">This workshop, available to attendees of all levels, will provide the required knowledge to perform post-exploitation actions on locked down Windows machines. Tools, tips and techniques will be shared to break out of restrictive execution environments and escalate privileges from low level user to SYSTEM on modern Windows operating systems. Contrary to common perception, Windows machines can be really well locked down if they are configured with care. As such attackers will need to dig deep in order to break out of restrictive environments and escalate privileges.</p>

<p class="abstract">The breakout portion of the workshop will cover fundamental techniques required to get a shell on applications which are deployed through Terminal Services and Citrix or in environments which have been locked down through Software Restriction Policies (SRPs) and  Group Policy.  Topics covered will include:</p>

<ul class="talkList">
<li>Abusing intended application functionality
<li>Bypassing folder path / type restrictions
<li>File protocol handlers
<li>Evading black / white lists.
</ul>

<p class="abstract">The Windows privilege escalation portion of the workshop aims to provide attendees with a solid understanding of the various steps required to escalate privileges from low level users to SYSTEM level privileges. Automated tools, such as meterpreter's "getsystem", have their place in this process however reliance on automation breeds weakness. Topics covered will include:</p>

<ul class="talkList">
<li>Enumeration of the target machine
<li>Identification of common and uncommon configuration weaknesses
<li>Permission analysis
<li>Analysis of Windows privilege escalation vulnerabilities
</ul>

<p class="abstract">Both portions of the workshop will have real-world examples that attendees can get their hands dirty with in order to solidify the theory. This workshop aims to provide hands-on knowledge which can be directly applied against locked down environments in the field. After taking this workshop you should always hide your smile when someone brags there is no way to compromise their locked down system!</p>

<p class="speakerBio">My name is <strong>Ruben Boonen</strong> (sometimes known as b33f). I have been working in InfoSec since 2012, one year as part of the Offensive Security team, assisting students from around the world as they worked through Offsec's various certifications and a further three years as a security consultant. I have a well-rounded skill set, having taken on many web application, infrastructure and bespoke engagements. I have, however, developed a special interest for Windows exploitation: Domain hacking, exploit development, client-side attacks, restricted environments, privilege escalation, persistence and post-exploitation.</p>

<p class="speakerBio">Not only do I enjoy breaking things but I also take great pleasure in helping others understand and replicate the attackers methodology. I was previously an assistant trainer for Offensive Security's Advanced Windows Exploitation course at Black Hat. Since 2011 I have also been maintaining an InfoSec blog to share interesting research with a wider audience.</p>

<p class="speakerBio">My name is <strong>Francesco Mifsud</strong>. I'm relatively  new to the InfoSec Industry but I've spent my fair share of sleepless nights staring at debuggers and  ASM. I've been working at Context Information Security for the past couple of years as a security consultant: Web applications, infrastructure jobs, mobile engagements, anything the company throws at me.</p>

<p class="speakerBio">During my research on exploit-development I have realized that a lot of material is out there on how to get a shell on the box, but not much on how to proceed afterwards. What happens if you don't get Admin or Root? If the obtained shell is severely restricted can you really say you have successfully compromised a machine?  Due to this, I have developed an interest in post-exploitation, namely Breakouts and Privilege Escalation. I have come a long way since then (or that's what I like to believe) and now it's time to pass this knowledge on to others!</p>

<h2 class="talkTitle">Advanced Blind SQL Injection Exploitation</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">David Caissy <span class="speakerTitle">Web App Penetration Tester, Albero Solutions Inc.</span></h3>


<p class="abstract">SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerabilities are the most common injection flaws found in web applications today, ranking number one in the OWASP Top 10 most critical web application security risks. When an attacker is able to find and exploit such a vulnerability, the end result is often disastrous: complete database downloaded, application backdoor created or even remote code execution. Suffice to say that penetration testers need to find these vulnerabilities before the bad guys do.</p>

<p class="abstract">But vulnerability scanners and automated exploitation tools like sqlmap can only do so much when it comes to finding and exploiting SQLi vulnerabilities. While they do a good job for regular or error-based SQLi vulnerabilities, their success rate lowers drastically when blind SQLi is encountered, especially when time-based attacks are required. And if you need to be quiet on the network, most tools are just insanely noisy…</p>

<p class="abstract">This course is designed to help penetration testers who have been using these tools to get to the next level, where finding and exploiting SQLi is no longer easy. When only a browser and notepad are available to you or when being quiet is critical, you will be glad you know this stuff.</p>

</ul>

<p class="abstract">We will have options for people who want to bring their own or just buy a kit.  Keep in mind, if you bring your own and dont bring everything - it may not work.  We wont have time to work around your specific configuration.  This workshop is free, however you need a ticket and a defcon badge to attend.  The kits are not free.  If something goes wrong and the conference is cancelled, then you will get the kit and documentation.  If something bad happens during the workshop (lose power, kicked out, no wifi, whatever) - sorry, its free (the workshop), but you will still have the kit if you bought that type of kit.</p>

<p class="abstract">KIT OVERVIEW: (Not Complete listing)</p>
<ul class="talkList">
<li>Raspberry Pi 3
<li>Case
<li>Power Supply(2.5amp)
<li>Display Screen (working on largest 5-7") - HDMI or Ribbon Based
<li>Potential Display Powersupply and Cable (pending)
<li>Relays
<li>Sensors (Distance and Motion)
<li>Bread Board
<li>Jumper Wires (Matched to work with sensors and such)
<li>MicroSD Card  (OS)
<li>MicroSD Card (Kali)
<li>Additional Wi-fi Adapter (beyond the one included)
<li>Keyboard w/ Touchpad
<li>Power Strip (At least 3 outlet)
<li>LEDs (Usual 2 wire type)
<li>Resistors
<li>Motor
<li>Buttons
<li>LED Strip
<li>Arduino (Yep you get one of these as well)
<li>Camera (Optional - see ticket add-on)
</ul> 

<p class="abstract">NOTE: We price the kit based on Electronics resellers such as MTM, Amazon, AdaFruit and trusted shipping companies in the US for bulk pricing.  We are working on getting as large an LCD screen and other features as possible.  If we get a good discount, you can expect more in your kit (surprise) and maybe some cash to roll at the tables.  We wont know quantity until late June, then expected ship times until very late June (i.e. right before DEF CON).  If we need to priority ship something that costs more money.  We price the kits to be standard, cost effective, and do not try to make money.  Our main goal is to make them standard as possible for the class to go smoothly in the time allowed, and ensure everything works together.  Nothings worse than getting everything in the kit but say the keyboard or the display, so we have to hedge our bets.  Based on previous workshops, people wanted to pay more for a larger screen vs a small 4inch screen.  People wanted to have options (such as camera or cool led strip) included vs parting it out. [i.e. a new person didn’t know what the camera or other items are used for].  When we get the exact parts list (models and pn) we will list here for someone bringing their own.  Previous workshops have shown bring your own did not generally work out very well (takes more time to get yours to work vs ours) - with a few exceptions.</p>

<p class="abstract"><strong>YOU NEED TO BRING:</strong></p>

<p class="abstract">LAPTOP (Recommend Windows 7 or Higher) with Wifi and Network ports<br>
SNACKS<br>
Suggest a extra power cord and outlet strip (not required, but we never know what the hotel will provide), we do a good job planning around this, but just in case.</p>  

<p class="abstract"><strong>OTHER Information:</strong></p>

<p class="abstract">If you buy a workshop BYOS ticket (IE you are bringing your own stuff), make sure you bring your own stuff.  Anyone who does not have their gear, will be asked to stand and make room for other peoples laptops and Raspberry Pi kits.  The cost on this ticket is only for the SD Cards to go through the workshop.  We wont have a complete list of what to bring until Mid/late July.  Watch this space for more info on what to order/bring.</p>

<p class="abstract">If you get the Free workshop ticket, then you will be asked to stand to make room for other attendees who bring their laptop and kits.  If there is room, then a seat may be made available.  We cannot guarantee seating for people who attend without a kit (just to watch) due to the space constraints in the room.  However you can download the presentation after the conference.</p>

<h3 class="speaker">Dazzle Cat Duo <span class="speakerTitle">Security Engineers</span></h3>


<p class="abstract">Jumping into the world of disassembly can be incredibly intimidating and quite painful. This talk aims to introduce disassembly by walking through how to recognize basic logic flows and data structures in assembly. We’ll look at locating common flow controllers such as if/else/loops/switch cases, as well as memory access and data structures. The talk will specifically address static disassembly using IDA, looking at c compiled to x86_32, but the principles can be applied to any other language and assembly architecture. x86, is one of the most common assembly architectures, and incredibly useful for security engineers to understand. x86 is the assembly architecture running almost all Mac, Windows, and Linux computers. </p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>The Dazzle Cat Duo</strong> are both security engineers who specialize in x86. In addition both serve as adjunct faculty members where they teach C and x86 .</p>

<h2>The in’s and out’s of Steganography</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Chuck Easttom <span class="speakerTitle">Computer Scientist</span></h3>


<p class="abstract">The class will start with an overview of basic steganography and a history. Now this part is probably common knowledge to many attendees. But then we will delve into specific tools including hiding data in wav files. We will also explore forensic techniques to detect steganography. Then we will look at cutting edge new steganography techniques. One of my 6 patents is for distributed steganography so that will be one of the new techniques we will explore. Finally, the training will culminate with reviewing actual source code that does steganography. Attendees will get the working source code to take with them.  The idea is to start with basics that probably over 3/4 of attendees know and then move deeper into topics most people don’t know. That way everyone can benefit from the workshop, both novices and experts.</p>

<h2 class="talkTitle">C/C++ Boot Camp for Hackers</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Eijah <span class="speakerTitle">Founder, demonsaw</span></h3>


<p class="abstract">The C/C++ programming language is one of the most important programming languages ever created.  Ever since Dennis Ritchie invented the language and Bjarne Stroustrup added object-oriented capabilities to it, C/C++ has been the standard by which all other languages are judged.  C/C++ is considered the lingua franca of UNIX, Linux, BSD, and Windows as well as many software toolsets including GNU, Aircrack-ng, and the GCC compiler.  And not only that, but C/C++ has influenced many other languages including C#, Java, Perl, PHP, and Python.</p>
 
<p class="abstract">As hackers, we sometimes have to write code.  And while there are more modern and higher-level languages available, C/C++ still plays a strong and prominent role in the hacking world due to its close ties to Linux and BSD.  Whether we're writing shell scripts, python programs, PHP websites, contributing to a FOSS project, reverse engineering a binary, or rebuilding/patching the OS kernel; having a familiarity with C/C++ gives us a tremendous advantage and adds a powerful tool to our hacker arsenal.</p>
 
<p class="abstract">This workshop is a C/C++ boot camp for hackers.  It's an intense hands-on experience designed to get you up-to-speed with the most important parts of the C/C++ programming language using the GCC/G++ compiler.  You'll learn about variables, functions, pointers, operators, classes, libraries, threads, templates, data structures, algorithms, exception handling, memory management, and design patterns.

<h2 class="talkTitle">Operation Dark Tangent: The DEF CON Messaging Protocol (DCMP) </h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Eijah <span class="speakerTitle">Founder, demonsaw</span></h3>


<p class="abstract">The war with the Machines has been brutal.  We've suffered so many casualties.  And now we're weak, and the Machines know it.  New D.C. is the last remaining human stronghold.  Right now the Machines are preparing for one final assault that, if successful, will mean the end of all humanity.  But it gets even worse.  We've just received word that our leader, the Dark Tangent, has been captured.  Without him we'll be unable to defend ourselves or mount a counter strike.</p>
 
<p class="abstract">Your mission is to lead a group of brave hackers to rescue the Dark Tangent.  But before you can do that you'll need to work together to devise a secure messaging protocol that the Machines won't be able to break.  This secure protocol is vital so that the troops can communicate in secret during the operation without the Machines figuring out what we're doing.  It's all up to you now.  Do you have what it takes to defeat the Machines?  Will you save us all?</p>
 
<p class="abstract"> This is a completely different kind of workshop.  I'll present a very specific infiltration scenario with attack vectors that we can expect the Machines to use, e.g. session hijacking, message poisoning, replay and MITM attacks, etc.  As a group we'll then work through our mission objectives and design a messaging protocol that will allow us to communicate securely.  Finally, we'll implement the protocol in C++ and use it to communicate with each other in real-time.  If everything works as expected we'll be able to defeat the Machines and rescue the Dark Tangent.  If not… then all of humanity is lost.</p>
 
<p class="abstract">Please note that this is an intermediate-level, technical workshop and requires that attendees have a strong working knowledge of C/C++.  Bring your laptop, a USB flash drive, and your favorite C/C++ 11 compiler (>= gcc/g++ 4.7 or msvc 2013).</p>

<p class="abstract">Fixing XSS is much harder than the generic recommendation lets on. They say "validate inputs and encode outputs." Great. Thanks. What should be allowed in? What should be encoded? What shouldn't? What is canonicalization? What packages can help me? These aren't easy questions to answer and most people get the complicated cases wrong.

<h2 class="talkTitle">Vulnerability Assessment & Exploitation of Crypto-Systems : A Bottom up Approach</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Ajit Hatti <span class="speakerTitle">Security Researcher</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">This is a unique workshop on "Vulnerability Assessment & Exploitation of Crypto-Systems". In this course, instead of taking the regular flaws in crypto-implementations or popular attacks from past,  we will take a holistic approach. Build strong understanding of the crypto-subsystems, their inherent security issues and how to discover, exploit and remediate them all in Flat-4-Hours.</p>

<p class="abstract">This workshop takes the participants to next level of practical crypto-assessment and exploitation. With deeper understanding of crypto-systems, plenty of hands on  vulnerability assessments and exploitation using Openssl and Open source tools and my custom scripts, participants will learn the important concepts which they can apply in real world RedTeam Pentesting or BlueTeam Defending, assessments & audits of crypto implementations.</p>

<p class="abstract">The workshop starts with a dive into the crypto systems present on participant’s own (virtual) machine. Taking a bottom up approach, we start form of Hardware Modules, Firmware, Crypto-Libraries, Network services & we will go all the way up to applications, trust/key stores, understanding the role of each layer in cryptography, test for quality + vulnerabilities and exploit them.</p>

<p class="abstract">Some of the unique modules covered in the workshop are testing the quality of numbers generated from RNGs & PRNGs from various sources, Extracting prime numbers from the Private keys, DH parameters, Secrete keys and testing for backdoors (Number Fixation), quality of randomness, Safety parameters (like Sofie German Test). And as we go upwards we will search and steal the insecure keys for network hopping like APT/malwares,  pin rogue certificates, bypass HSTS checks to steal cookies, exploit certificate switching, Look for Seeds used in PRNG functions, re-usage of keys and flaws in SCEP implementations. And we top it up with the popular named Attacks from HEARTBLEED to LOGJAM and other popular CVEs.</p>

<p class="abstract">I will be sharing numerous scripts written by me and open source tools  which participants can use to test or automate the assessment of their own crypto-systems.</p>

<p class="abstract">Workshop is best suited for pen-testers, developers, security engineers, auditors, compliance consultants in general but a must for those who deal with products or services involving cryptography and PKI implementations.

<h3 class="speaker">Ioannis Koniaris <span class="speakerTitle">Security Engineer</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">In the field of computer security, honeypots are systems aimed at deceiving malicious users or software that launch attacks against the servers and network infrastructure of various organizations. They can be deployed as protection mechanisms for an organization’s real systems, or as research units to study and analyze the methods employed by human hackers or malware. In this workshop we will outline the operation of two research honeypots, by manual deployment and testing in real time. A honeypot system will undertake the role of a web trap for attackers who target the SSH service in order to gain illegal server access. Another one will undertake the role of a malware collector, usually deployed by malware analysts and anti-virus companies to gather and securely store malicious binary samples. We will also talk about post-capturing activities and further analysis techniques. As an example, we will see how to index all the captured information in a search engine like Elasticsearch and then utilize ElastAlert, an easy to use framework to setup meaningful alerting. Lastly, visualization tools will be presented for the aforementioned systems, plus a honeypot bundle Linux distribution that contains pre-configured versions of the above tools and much more related utilities, which can make the deployment of honeypots in small or large networks an easy task.</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Ioannis</strong> is an Information Security engineer and researcher, working to protect company assets, data and operations.

<p class="abstract">This workshop takes the very best of our Black Hat cloud security defensive training classes and crams them into a high-speed, 4-hour DEF CON session. If you work in cloud, or are just cloud-curious, we’ll get you up to speed on the latest and greatest practical techniques for securing Amazon Web Services. We are cutting out all the theory to focus exclusively on the technical implementation.</p>

<p class="abstract">Before coming to the session you should know what AWS is and be able to launch and connect to an instance (we’ll provide instructions ahead of time just to be safe). You should also be comfortable with a Linux command line and basic scripting. That’s all you need walking in, but by the time you leave we will have shown you:</p>

<ul class="talkList">
<li>How to build complex AWS virtual networks with cross-account and VPC connectivity.
<li>How to leverage auto scale groups for building immutable infrastructure. What’s that? Servers that are impossible to log into and replaced every few hours with 0 downtime.
<li>Techniques for advanced IAM policies in AWS. For example, using tags or other conditionals for dynamic, fine-grained access.
<li>Building server less infrastructure for automating security. You can, and we sh*t you not, create actual self-healing infrastructure in AWS without any running servers.
<li>Automation techniques to play with the AWS APIs like a boss. Sure, we’ll focus on the defensive side, but let’s just say you offensive types might pick up a thing or two.
<li>How to build an automated deployment pipeline using Git, Jenkins, Packer, and Ansible to push new images to AWS. (We’ll use a scripted build for time, but you’ll see how it all pieces together).
<li>If we have time, we’ll show you how t use Amazon’s Key Management Service to encrypt… everything. Plus cover how to make things subpoena proof, if you are into that sort of thing.
</ul>

<p class="abstract">The focus of the workshop is on defense, and how to best use the tools in AWS for security. We can’t cover anything in four hours, so we will focus on the technical techniques you can use to most-quickly build up your skills. </p>

<p class="abstract">Can you guarantee that the software you created does not contain any runtime errors or data races and would not be susceptible to buffer overflow or floating point errors? Can you create a program that can take any arbitrary program as an input and certify it as free from such errors or alert you of possible avenues of errors? Is such a thing even possible? Turns out, yes you can, or  at least after this training you will be able to.</p>

<p class="abstract">Recent advances in the field of formal program analysis have led to development of theories and tools that can, given a program as input, either guarantee absence of certain types of errors or raise alarms to alert of possible weaknesses in the given program. Sounds like black magic? The goal of this training is to de-mystify the science behind automated program analysis and build a solid foundation for attendees to start building their own tools that can automatically analyze and certify code correctness.</p>

<p class="abstract">The workshop will cover the challenges in automated program analysis, what is possible and what is not possible, and why. We will focus on using Abstract Interpretation, a widely used formal framework, for describing sound by construction program analysis algorithms as approximations of semantics of the language. Finally, in the hands-on session,  we will build our own code analyzer for a simple language that can analyze any program written in that language and issue certificates of correctness.</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Vivek Notani</strong> is a PhD student at University of Verona, under Dr. Roberto Giacobazzi. Previously, Vivek used to work as a research scholar at University of Louisiana at Lafayette (USA) focusing on dynamic methods of malware analysis and machine learning applications to malware analysis and reverse engineering. His research at UL Lafayette led to the creation of Virusbattle, an automated malware analysis system that harvests intelligence from large malware repositories which was presented at BlackHat last year. VirusBattle has since been commercialized by Cythereal LLC. USA. Early on in his career, Vivek used to work in humanoid robotics and helped create Acyut, series of India's first indigenously developed humanoid robot which created a world record in humanoid weightlifting at FIRA-2010.</p>

From 1993 to 1995 he had a Post Doctoral Research position at Laboratoire d'Informatique (LIX), Ecole Polytechnique (Paris) in the equipe Cousot, the creator of the theory of Abstract Interpretation. His research interests include abstract interpretation, static program analysis, semantics of programming languages, program verification, abstract model-checking, program transformation and optimization, digital asset protection, code obfuscation, software watermarking and lattice theory. He is author of more than 100 publications in international journals and conferences and he is involved in national (italian) and international (european) research projects in the field of static program analysis. His main current research interest is in formal methods for systematic design of domains and transfer functions  or abstract interpretation, with application in security, digital asset protection, code obfuscation, watermarking, malware analysis, semantics, program analysis, and abstract model-checking. In the past, he gave a declarative semantics for Prolog control features and he studied new methodologies to design static program analyzers and optimization techniques for logic and constraint-based languages by abstract interpretation. In lattice theory he contributed to understanding of the structure of the lattice of closure operators and complete congruence relations on complete lattices. He is in the Steering Committee of the Static Analysis Symposium and of the ACM Conference on Principles of Programming Languages, POPL. Dr. Giacobazzi's research in abstract interpretation led to the creation of Julia in 2006, which has since been acquired by the Corvallis Group,a leading firm in software development and assurance  in the banking market.</p>

<p class="abstract">DEF CON isn’t just for hardened hackers with 5up3r 3l173 hacking skills. As DEF CON has grown, more and more attendees are looking for knowledge that will help them get started in the world of hacking. If that’s what you’re looking for, this training workshop is for you!</p>

<p class="abstract">This training will teach students how to discover and exploit their first buffer overflow exploit. This is not a class in how to use the tool of the day; students will be writing their own tools in Python every step of the way.  Students will learn how to configure their virtual lab environment, how to write a fuzzer that can produce a crash in a network service, how to take control of a crash, and how to embed a customized payload in order to complete the exploit. As time permits, there will also be a discussion of writing Windows payloads by hand in shellcode.</p>

<p class="abstract">Understanding exploit development is good. Understanding how to prevent exploits is better. In addition to examining the offensive techniques involved in exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities, students will dig through C source code to understand these vulnerabilities and how they could be mitigated. As time permits, there will also be a discussion of host-based mitigation strategies such as DEP and ASLR.</p>

<h3 class="speaker">Robert Simmons <span class="speakerTitle">Director of Research Innovation, ThreatConnect, Inc.</span></h3>


<p class="abstract">The landscape of open source malware analysis tools improves every day. A malware analysis lab can be thought of as a set of entry points into a tool chain. The main entry points are a file, a URL, a network traffic capture, and a memory image. This talk is an examination of the major open source tools that satisfy the analysis requirements for each of these entry points. Each tool’s output can potentially feed into another tool for further analysis. The linking of one tool to the next in a tool chain allows one to build a comprehensive automated malware analysis lab using open source software.</p>

<p class="abstract">For file analysis, the three major versions of Cuckoo Sandbox will be examined. To analyze a potentially malicious URL, the low-interaction honeyclient, Thug, will be covered. Next, if one has a network capture (PCAP) to analyze, the Bro Network Security Monitor is a great option, and will be covered. Finally, if the analysis target is a memory image, the Volatility Framework will be examined. Each of the inputs and outputs of the tools will be reviewed to expose ways that they can be chained together for the purpose of automation. For each tool covered, the class will login to live instances of each and learn the basics of malware analysis using each one.</p>

<p class="abstract">Detecting advanced threats is now under the assumption of impossibility or unlikeliness. One of the main waves in cyber security promising to enable that ability is cyber deception, a field that has garnered much attention and investments in the last couple of years. Based on the same concepts as honeypots, but on a different technology, cyber deception promises to create decoys and other assets to make attackers expose themselves and allow it's users to not only detect them, but collect forensics that can be used for immediate mitigation.</p> 

<p class="abstract">During this workshop, attendees will learn about MazeRunner, Cymmetria's cyber deception solution which is being released for the first time as the first cyber deception free general use tool. Along with it they will be able to set up deception across environments that will be composed of decoys - real virtual machines that can be linux/windows systems. Configure these machines with different network protocols and content to make them look like anything to deceive a hacker, and lastly creating the connections and credentials to these configurations to deploy to the endpoints, thereby creating a complete layer of deception to lead an attacker. Next we will show how to use the alerts and forensics gathered in order to enable automatic mitigation of threats and enrich your threat intel efforts.</p>

<p>This workshop is an introduction to osquery, an open source SQL-powered operating system for instrumentation and analytics. osquery is developed and used by Facebook to proactively hunt for abnormalities. Since osquery allows us to easily ask questions about our infrastructure, it provides powerful capabilities, such as finding malware persistence techniques and scanning IOCs across our fleets of machines. This workshop is a very hands-on training and we expect participants to be comfortable with CLI. The workshop is broken into three components:<br><br>

Part I - hunting malware with osquery (1.5 hours) The first section of the workshop will make use of the interactive osquery command line tool (osqueryi) to hunt for characteristics of malware residing on a local system. The goal of this section is to get students familiar with writing SQL statements and to understand how osquery makes use of core tables to abstract operating system artifacts.<br><br>

Part II - osquery at scale (1.5 hours): The second part of the workshop will focus on automation and deployment of osquery at a larger scale. You will learn how to write “query packs” which are utilized to collect and analyze the results from various endpoints in an enterprise. We will demonstrate this concept with the use of virtual machines, however the methodologies can be extrapolated to larger enterprises.<br><br>

Part III - osquery development (optional - 0.5 to 1 hours): The last part of the workshop focuses on osquery development. We will walk you through some of the core components of osquery so you can have a deeper understand of this application. The goal being to give the student sufficient information to hack on the osquery project. This segment is largely optional and designed for people who want to get familiar with how osquery works under the hood.<br><br>

<h3 class="speaker">Georgia Weidman <span class="speakerTitle">CEO & Founder, Shevirah</span></h3>


<p class="abstract">This class will be conducted using Kali Linux against Windows and Linux target virtual machines. Students will become familiar with the phases of the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) and the common tools of the trade such as Metasploit, Nmap, Nessus, Maltego and others. Beginning with using Kali Linux and the  Metasploit Framework, this course will then simulate each phase of penetration testing with the target virtual machines. Students will learn how to gather information about a target organization using open source reconnaissance, discover and verify vulnerabilities on targets, and use tools, public exploits, and manual techniques to exploit issues. In post exploitation we will gather information, pivot onto additional networks, perform privilege escalation, etc. Due to the short time this course is a great kick starter into completing additional material on penetration testing including an additional penetration testing target from the instructors book and an online lab of additional targets of varying difficulty which will be made available to students at the end of the course.</p>

<h2 class="talkTitle">Physical Security for Computing Systems, a Look at Design, Attacks and Defenses</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Steve Weingart <span class="speakerTitle">Security Researcher</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">Physical security for computing systems is a topic that usually gets left to FIPS 140 and tamper labels, but it is a much broader and more interesting subject.  As the value of data on computing systems increases and operating systems become more secure, physical attacks on computing systems to steal or modify assets become more likely.  At the low end are locks and tamper labels, at the high end are complex mechanisms to detect and respond to tampering and intrusion from the box level all the way down to the chip level. All of this technology requires constant review and improvement, just as other competitive technologies need review to stay at the leading edge. The bar is ever rising.</p>
 
<p class="abstract">Physical security is an interdisciplinary field.  The materials and chemistry are as important as the electronics, circuits and physics.  A tamper label can be defeated by application of the right solvent.  A cover switch can be defeated by piping super glue in through an air vent or a slightly bent cover.  Hard epoxies can be removed with drain cleaner and a tamper detection circuit can be defeated by setting the supply voltage to a critical value or a microprocessor's start up tests bypassed by manipulating the width of the reset pulse.</p>
 
<p class="abstract">This training session will show many of the known attack and defense methods from the basic to the exotic.  It will include easy and low tech ways of performing high tech attacks, as well as descriptions of the highest tech methods.</p>
 
<p class="abstract">Design examples will be shown with examples of the tools, devices, circuits and materials used to implement both attack and defense systems.  Demonstrations will be included.</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Steve Weingart</strong> has been active in the Security Standards and Physical Security communities since the 1980's.  He was on the NIST panel that wrote FIPS 140-1 and has been a continuing contributor to both FIPS 140 and Common Criteria development.  At the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, he was the lead engineer for the IBM 4758 secure coprocessor which was the first cryptographic module validated at Security Level 4 under FIPS 140-1.  He has continued to work in the security field as a developer of secure cryptographic modules, a consultant, a standards test lab engineer and as a standards test lab manager.  Steve now coordinates security standard certifications for Aruba and continues to consult, contribute to the standards community and trains others in security standards and physical security.</p>

<h2 class="talkTitle">Hacking Network Protocols using Kali</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Thomas Wilhelm <span class="speakerTitle">Associate Professor, NSACAE University</span></h3>
<h3 class="speaker">Todd Kendall<span class="speakerTitle">Security Consultant</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">There are a lot of hacking tutorials on how to compromise servers, but what about network devices?</p>

<p class="abstract">In this workshop, we will demonstrate how to conduct penetration tests against a number of different network protocols, specifically those at layer 2 and 3 of the OSI model, in order to assess and circumvent the security of an organization. Participants will be able to watch a demonstration on how to leverage insecurities in different protocols, and replicate the attacks themselves in a lab environment at the workshop. In addition, we will discuss what steps network engineers can do to limit the insecurities.</p>

<p class="abstract">This workshop will contain network devices in which participants will be able to connect to and perform the demonstrated attacks. Participation will be reduced since network equipment resources are limited, unless additional lab equipment can be procured.</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Thomas Wilhelm</strong> has been an associate professor at an NSACAE university, who has taught information assurance for many years at both the masters and undergraduate level. He has been a penetration tester and team lead for fortune 100 companies, and spent the last 20+ years involved in information security.</p>

<p class="speakerBio">Thomas has written and authored numerous articles and books over the years on hacking; the latest is titled “Professional Penetration Testing (vol 2),” published by Syngress, which has been printed in multiple languages. Thomas holds two masters degrees (MSCS, MSM) and maintains the following certifications: ISSMP, CISSP, CCNP Security, SCSECA, SCNA, SCSA, IEM, IAM</p>

<p class="abstract"><strong>Max Class Size:</strong> 32<br>
<strong>Prerequisites for students:</strong> It is required for students to understand the OSI model and specifics of well-known network protocols, particularly those found at layer 2 and layer 3 of the OSI model.<br>
<strong>Materials or Equipment students will need to bring to participate:</strong> Participants should have a laptop that contains an up to date Kali Linux image. In addition, if they want to participate in actual network protocol attacks, they should bring CAT5 cables for connectivity. This class will not spend time getting students online - participants should already be familiar with configuring static IP addresses and/or DHCP for their systems. Because participants will be able to connect to a lab environment with active exploits, it is suggested that students use a computer system that can be easily re-imaged at the end of the workshop.</p>

<h2 class="talkTitle">Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Evasion Techniques</h2>

<p class="abstract">In most professional penetration tests, the pentester is given unrestricted, unfettered access to a network. However, this does not provide an effective evaluation of all preventative measures available to an organization that prevent and identify ongoing attacks. As a result, more businesses now require pentesters to confront Intrusion Detection / Prevention Systems aimed at limiting attacks in their network. The ability to understand how IDS/IPS systems work and effective techniques to circumvent their efforts to restrict your activities within the network is becoming essential for pentesters.</p>

<p class="abstract">In this workshop, we will build an IPS system and examine their inherent limitations. We will then perform attacks within a test lab environment to see how effective the IPS is against our typical attacks. Once we understand how IPS systems limit our ability to pentest, we will then look at ways to exploit IPS limitations to be more effective in our professional penetration tests.</p>

<h2 class="talkTitle">Brainwashing Embedded Systems</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Craig Young <span class="speakerTitle">Security Researcher, Tripwire</span></h3>


<p class="abstract">Learning the secret incantations to make embedded systems carry out your will is not as hard as one might think. In the world of IoT, the hardened system is rare and most times a firmware image is more than enough to find and exploit weakness. This session explains in detail a process for going from zero-knowledge to zero-day on real-world devices without breaking a sweat. Attendees to this tutorial session will learn the ropes of firmware dissection, app decompilation, and manual fuzz testing in a hands-on hack lab. Participants will be provided with a customized Kali Linux virtual appliance and given access to several consumer devices for analysis. These techniques have been successfully employed by the author to identify over 100 CVEs on embedded/IoT devices as well as to win the 0-day and CTF tracks in the DEF CON 22 SOHOpelessly Broken router hacking competition.</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Craig Young</strong> is a computer security researcher with Tripwire's Vulnerability and Exposures Research Team (VERT). He has identified and responsibly disclosed dozens of vulnerabilities in products from Google, Amazon, IBM, NETGEAR, Adobe, HP, Apple, and others. His research has resulted in numerous CVE assignments and repeated recognition in the Google Application Security Hall of Fame. Craig's presentations on Google authentication weaknesses have led to considerable security improvements for all Google users. Craig won in track 0 and track 1 of the first ever SOHOpelessly Broken contest at DEF CON 22 by demonstrating 10 0-day flaws in SOHO wireless routers. His research into iOS WiFi problems more recently exposed CVE-2015-3728 that could allow devices to inadvertently connect to malicious hot spots. Craig has more recently turned his attention to a different part of the wireless spectrum with research into home automation products as well as RFID/NFC technology.</p>
